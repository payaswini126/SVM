Cat vs Dog Classification using SVM
This project classifies cats and dogs using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The images of cats and dogs are processed to differentiate between these two classes.

Features
Image Classification: Classifies input images as either Cat or Dog.
SVM Model: A linear kernel SVM model is used.
Visualization: View sample test images and their predictions.
Requirements
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
How to Run
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cat-vs-dog-svm.git
Prepare Dataset: Add your Cat and Dog images in respective folders:

bash
Copy code
/dataset/cats  
/dataset/dogs
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python cat_dog_classification.py
Workflow
Dataset:

Images are preprocessed (resized to 64x64 grayscale images).
Label 0: Cat, Label 1: Dog.
SVM Model:

A Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with a linear kernel is trained.
Evaluation:

Accuracy is measured on test data.
Random test images are displayed with predictions.
Output Example
java
Copy code
Training SVM Model...
Test Accuracy (SVM): 95.00%
Sample Prediction Image:

Cat Image:
Dog Image:
Future Improvements
Use deep learning models like CNN for better accuracy.
Support multi-class animal recognition.
